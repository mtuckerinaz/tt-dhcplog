# tt-dhcplog

This program is built in C# and simply opens Server 2012 R2 DHCP log files.
I haven't tested it on anything else, this is here for pure convenience for anyone in my position who needs a quick way to sort through a DHCP log file.

Search is seriously very basic but will be implemented in its full glory at some point down the road.

This is nothing Excel can't do, but I created this because I just wanted to be able to open the file and not mess with setting up columns and then not knowing what the ID codes meant without referring to something else. Plan to actually make this an analyzer as time progresses.
