# tt-dhcplog

This program is built in C# and simply opens Server 2012 R2 DHCP log files.
I haven't tested it on anything else, this is here for pure convenience for anyone in my position who needs a quick way to sort through a DHCP log file.

Search is seriously very basic but will be implemented in its full glory at some point down the road.
